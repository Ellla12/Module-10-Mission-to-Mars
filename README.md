# Module 10: Mission To Mars

## Summary
Robin, who loves astronomy and wants to work for NASA one day, has decided to use a specific method of gathering the latest data: web scraping.
Using this technique, she has the ability to pull data from multiple websites, store it in a database, then present the collected data in a central location: a webpage.

For this challenge, we will be helping Robin complete the following:
- Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
- Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components
